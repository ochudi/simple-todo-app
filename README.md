# Simple To-Do App in Rust: Perseus and Sycamore

This is a simple to-do app built using Rust programming language with the Perseus and Sycamore frameworks. It was created as part of a student guest-lecture for *Advance in Web, Mobile, and Blockchain: CSC419*.

## Introduction

This application serves as a demonstration of building a basic to-do list using Rust, Perseus, and Sycamore. It showcases the implementation of a simple yet functional to-do list application leveraging these technologies.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Utilizes Rust language for robustness and performance.
- Built with Perseus and Sycamore frameworks for frontend development.

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: A systems programming language known for its speed, reliability, and performance.
- **Perseus**: A web framework for Rust that allows creating full-stack web applications.
- **Sycamore**: A reactive library for creating web apps in Rust and WebAssembly

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-todo-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd simple-todo-app
   ```

3. **Install Perseus (if not installed):**
   Make sure you have Perseus and its dependencies installed. You can follow the installation instructions in the [Perseus documentation](https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/docs).

4. **Build and run the application using Perseus:**
   Run the following command to start the Perseus server in watch mode:
   ```bash
   perseus serve -w
   ```
   This command will initiate the Perseus development server, watching for changes in your project files, and automatically rebuilding and updating the application as you make changes.
